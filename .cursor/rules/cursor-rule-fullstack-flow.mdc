# Full-Stack Flow - BORING Simple-MVP Project

## Application Flow Overview

This project follows a structured full-stack flow where each layer has clear responsibilities:

1. **Page Definition**: Everything starts in `/src/app` where we define Next.js App Router pages
2. **Protected Routes**: Dashboard views are in `/src/app/(dashboard)` with authentication protection
3. **Components**: UI components in `/src/components` handle presentation and user interaction
4. **Custom Hooks**: Data fetching logic in `/src/hooks` provides data to components
5. **API Routes**: Backend logic in `/src/app/api` handles server-side operations
6. **Database**: All database operations use Prisma ORM

## Detailed Flow Implementation

### 1. Page Definition (Entry Point)
- Pages defined in `/src/app` serve as the entry points to the application
- Server components fetch initial data and handle authentication checks
- Example: `/src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` checks session before rendering

### 2. Component Structure
- Components in `/src/components` are organized by domain and function
- Layout components (like `dashboard-layout-client.tsx`) define the structure
- Feature components implement specific functionality
- All components follow accessibility best practices and use shadcn/ui

### 3. Data Fetching Flow
- Custom hooks in `/src/hooks` abstract API communication
- Example: `useCurrentUser` hook provides authenticated user data and profile
- Hooks use React Query for caching, loading states, and error handling
- Data flows from hooks to components via props or context

### 4. API Implementation
- API routes in `/src/app/api` follow RESTful conventions
- Routes are organized by domain (auth, profile, etc.)
- Each route handles specific HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- API routes authenticate requests using Supabase Auth helpers

### 5. Database Operations
- All database queries use Prisma client exclusively
- API routes use Prisma to interact with the database
- Example: `/src/app/api/profile/route.ts` uses Prisma to fetch and update profiles
- Transactions are used for multi-step operations

## Authentication Flow
1. User authenticates via Supabase Auth
2. Auth state is managed through custom hooks and context
3. Protected routes check session before rendering
4. API routes verify authentication before processing requests

## Data Flow Example
1. User navigates to dashboard page
2. Server component checks authentication
3. Dashboard components render using client components
4. Client components use hooks to fetch data
5. Hooks call API routes with authentication tokens
6. API routes validate requests and use Prisma for database operations
7. Data flows back through the stack to render in the UI

## Best Practices Enforced
- Separation of concerns at each layer
- Type safety throughout the application with TypeScript
- Proper error handling at every level
- Authentication checks in both pages and API routes
- Consistent patterns for data fetching and state management
